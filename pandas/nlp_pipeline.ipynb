         "One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",

         "A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.",

The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her \"sexy\" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \"Devil Wears Prada\" and more interesting than \"Superman\" a great comedy to go see with friends.",

         "Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.",

I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film.

Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br />Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of \"SPOILER\" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven't even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh..

         "\"The Cell\" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \"The Cell\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the \"genre\" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But \"The Cell\" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \"The Cell\" wants to let you \"see\" what it's all about and not \"how\" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought \"The Cell\" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as \"weird\" or \"crazy\". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say \"Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\" If so, I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)",

Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era \"Cold Mountain,\" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Ren√©e Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"Glory\" director Edward Zwick shame. However, \"Cold Mountain\" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />\"Cold Mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Ren√©e Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of Northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, \"Cold Mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",

         "Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \"message\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage.",

         "\"Ardh Satya\" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",

         "One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". The first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita √® Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others.

         "I bought this film at Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Having watched it, I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' \"Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show\"). This would barely qualify as PG-13 (it is Not Rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It is, but not in that way.<br /><br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), it's teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I've been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.",

The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house?

The \"reasoning\" behind each plot turn and new \"clue\" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for \"never shutting up.\" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a \"Dr.\" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, \"Don't you ever shut up?\" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque.

I thought that \"God's Army\" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, \"well, maybe it will get better.\" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, which I'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy.

         "Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.",

And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though.

You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears.

This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.",

         "one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many..aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...oz doesn't mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn't say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",

         "a wonderful little production. <br /><br />the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.",

         "'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich√©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era \"cold mountain,\" starring jude law, nicole kidman and ren√©e zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />then again, calling cold mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"glory\" director edward zwick shame. however, \"cold mountain\" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />\"cold mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by ren√©e zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.<br /><br />within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />make no mistake, \"cold mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",

         "one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". the first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). <br /><br />never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita √® bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world.",

         "preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.<br /><br />there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.<br /><br />typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.",

         "'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich√©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era \"cold mountain,\" starring jude law, nicole kidman and ren√©e zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />then again, calling cold mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"glory\" director edward zwick shame. however, \"cold mountain\" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />\"cold mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by ren√©e zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.<br /><br />within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />make no mistake, \"cold mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",

         "i bought this film at blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it. i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. i was 100% wrong.<br /><br />having watched it, i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (honestly! i don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to ray stevens' \"would jesus wear a rolex on his television show\"). this would barely qualify as pg-13 (it is not rated), but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream, but they insist that zack and reba is worse.<br /><br />it is, but not in that way.<br /><br />in a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like the virgin suicides), it's teenagers. if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect, then i have little chance of turning a story i've been writing into a pg-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (i think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.",

         "preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.<br /><br />there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.<br /><br />typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.",

         "one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many..aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...oz doesn't mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn't say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",

         "a wonderful little production. the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.",

         "'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich√©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era \"cold mountain,\" starring jude law, nicole kidman and ren√©e zellweger is such a film.then again, calling cold mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"glory\" director edward zwick shame. however, \"cold mountain\" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.\"cold mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by ren√©e zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.make no mistake, \"cold mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",

         "taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \"message\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who's assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in.abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...).curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (richard brooks' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. the victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage.",

         "\"ardh satya\" is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema. directed by the great director govind nihalani, this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success. even today, ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india.the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s. unlike any police of other cities in india, mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether. govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment.amongst various police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of anand velankar, a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family. his father is a harsh police constable. anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother. anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction. the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction. resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.the spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. he is aware of the system of the metro, where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end. his compromise towards unethical practice is negative. finally he gets suspended.the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. at many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments.the practical approach of script is a major punch. alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today. those aspects are dealt brilliantly.finally, the films belongs to the one man show, om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",

         "one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles. this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". the first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita √® bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world.",

(philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.",

(elijah wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????>and the whole machine vs. humans theme was the matrix..or terminator.....there are more examples but why waste the time? and will someone tell me what was with the nazi's?!?! nazi's???? there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. the movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either. just awful. a real disappointment to say the least. save your money.",

         "'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich√©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era \"cold mountain,\" starring jude law, nicole kidman and ren√©e zellweger is such a film.then again, calling cold mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"glory\" director edward zwick shame. however, \"cold mountain\" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.\"cold mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by ren√©e zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.make no mistake, \"cold mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",

         "one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles. this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". the first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita √® bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world.",

         "ever watched a movie that lost the plot? well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.where to begin? the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. what do they do? slide down and run like the rest of us? no, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.it really is only a movie as they say..",

         "after sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. it was that listless and formulaic. but the u.s. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, \"we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it\" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq, etc. the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like, \"i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip\" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene. the \"reasoning\" behind each plot turn and new \"clue\" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. and there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with dr. whatever-her-name-was being chided by all involved for \"never shutting up.\" she's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a \"dr.\" title on her character to give her some gravity. at one point, cage's character says, \"don't you ever shut up?\" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. truly grotesque. the only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. creepy....",

         "preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.",

         "petter mattei's \"love in the time of money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. mr. mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect. each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.the acting is good under mr. mattei's direction. steve buscemi, rosario dawson, carol kane, michael imperioli, adrian grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.we wish mr. mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work."

         "'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich√©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era \"cold mountain,\" starring jude law, nicole kidman and ren√©e zellweger is such a film.then again, calling cold mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"glory\" director edward zwick shame. however, \"cold mountain\" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.\"cold mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by ren√©e zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it is hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.make no mistake, \"cold mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether."

         "taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \"message\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who is assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in.abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who is leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it is pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there is no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...).curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it is based on (richard brooks' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics do not fit so smoothly. the victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there is a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage."

         "\"ardh satya\" is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema. directed by the great director govind nihalani, this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success. even today, ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india.the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s. unlike any police of other cities in india, mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether. govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment.amongst various police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of anand velankar, a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family. his father is a harsh police constable. anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother. anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction. the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction. resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.the spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. he is aware of the system of the metro, where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end. his compromise towards unethical practice is negative. finally he gets suspended.the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. at many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments.the practical approach of script is a major punch. alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today. those aspects are dealt brilliantly.finally, the films belongs to the one man show, om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly."

         "one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we are introduced to him at the start of the film, he is been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you cannot bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles. this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who will not even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". the first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that is been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it is almost impossible to pin-point its because (if indeed there is one). the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he has not seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it is never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita √® bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world."

(philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america."
