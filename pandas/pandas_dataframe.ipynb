         "As India  the world's largest democracy  braces itself for another general election- with 9 million polling booths  more than 800 million voters  and costing nearly $5 billion -- Newton Kumar  a rookie government clerk finds himself entrusted with a task that appears deceptively simple: conducting elections in a remote village in the jungles of central India. The bushes teem with Communist guerrillas  who have been waging a decades old war against the state  even as the indigenous tribals live without any access to mainland amenities. Conducting 'free and fair' elections in a minefield like this is no child's play  as Newton learns over the course of this eventful day. Unfazed with the cynicism and danger all around him  Newton is determined to do his duty. But  as they say in the jungle  'The more things change  the worse they will get'.",

It is to this India  which is colorful  heterogeneous and complex that Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan)  a bright young scientist working as a project manager in NASA  returns to on a quest to find his childhood nanny. The film uses the contrast between the highly developed world of NASA  which has been at the forefront of advances in space research  and this world back home in India  which is at the crossroads of development. Mohan's simple quest becomes the journey that every one of us goes through in search of that metaphysical and elusive place called \"home\".",

         "As India  the world's largest democracy  braces itself for another general election- with 9 million polling booths  more than 800 million voters  and costing nearly $5 billion -- Newton Kumar  a rookie government clerk finds himself entrusted with a task that appears deceptively simple: conducting elections in a remote village in the jungles of central India. The bushes teem with Communist guerrillas  who have been waging a decades old war against the state  even as the indigenous tribals live without any access to mainland amenities. Conducting 'free and fair' elections in a minefield like this is no child's play  as Newton learns over the course of this eventful day. Unfazed with the cynicism and danger all around him  Newton is determined to do his duty. But  as they say in the jungle  'The more things change  the worse they will get'.",

The son of a driver  his parents worked hard to get him educated so that he could have a white collar job. Meanwhile  Murad realizes his calling to be a rapper. Authentic Hip Hop in India is a recent phenomenon and like anywhere else in the world  is rising from the streets. Art is a distant dream for the colonized poor of India and this story is about Murad's journey from realizing his love for rap and chasing his dream to inadvertently transcending his class.
