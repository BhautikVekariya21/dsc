# Machine Learning Algorithms: Types and Descriptions

## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### 1.1 Classification Algorithms

Classification predicts discrete categorical outcomes or class labels.

#### Linear Classification

- **Logistic Regression**: Uses the logistic function to model the probability of class membership. Works well for binary and multiclass problems with linearly separable data.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Finds linear combinations of features that best separate classes by maximizing between-class variance and minimizing within-class variance.

#### Tree-Based Methods

- **Decision Trees**: Creates a tree-like model of decisions by splitting data based on feature values. Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest**: Combines multiple decision trees using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects errors from previous models. Includes XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

#### Instance-Based Learning

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

#### Probabilistic Methods

- **Naive Bayes**: Applies Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features. Works well with text classification and small datasets.

#### Support Vector Machines

- **SVM**: Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes with maximum margin. Can handle non-linear relationships using kernel functions.

#### Neural Networks

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers that can learn complex non-linear patterns.

### 1.2 Regression Algorithms

Regression predicts continuous numerical values.

#### Linear Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Models relationship between one independent variable and dependent variable using a straight line.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extends simple linear regression to multiple independent variables.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Uses polynomial functions to model non-linear relationships.

#### Regularized Regression

- **Ridge Regression (L2)**: Adds L2 penalty term to prevent overfitting by shrinking coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression (L1)**: Adds L1 penalty term that can shrink coefficients to zero, performing feature selection.
- **Elastic Net**: Combines both L1 and L2 penalties for balanced regularization.

#### Tree-Based Regression

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. It discovers structure in data where the correct output is unknown.

### 2.1 Clustering Algorithms

Clustering groups similar data points together without predefined categories.

#### Centroid-Based Clustering

- **K-Means**: Partitions data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster sum of squares. Assumes spherical clusters of similar sizes.
- **K-Medoids**: Similar to K-means but uses actual data points as cluster centers, making it more robust to outliers.

#### Hierarchical Clustering

- **Agglomerative**: Bottom-up approach that starts with individual points and merges closest clusters iteratively.
- **Divisive**: Top-down approach that starts with all data in one cluster and recursively splits clusters.

#### Density-Based Clustering

- **DBSCAN**: Groups points that are closely packed while marking outliers in low-density regions. Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.
- **OPTICS**: Extension of DBSCAN that creates a reachability plot to identify clusters of varying densities.

#### Distribution-Based Clustering

- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Assumes data comes from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and uses expectation-maximization algorithm to find parameters.

### 2.2 Dimensionality Reduction

Reduces the number of features while preserving important information.

#### Linear Methods

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Finds principal components that capture maximum variance in data. Widely used for data visualization and preprocessing.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Reduces dimensions while maximizing class separability (when used for dimensionality reduction).

- **UMAP**: Preserves both local and global structure, faster than t-SNE for large datasets.
- **Kernel PCA**: Non-linear extension of PCA using kernel functions.

### 2.3 Association Rule Learning

Finds relationships between different variables in large databases.

- **Apriori Algorithm**: Identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on support and confidence thresholds.
- **FP-Growth**: More efficient than Apriori, uses frequent pattern tree structure to mine frequent itemsets.

### 2.4 Anomaly Detection

Identifies unusual patterns or outliers in data.

- **Isolation Forest**: Isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and split values.
- **One-Class SVM**: Learns the boundary of normal data points in high-dimensional space.
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Measures local density deviation of data points with respect to neighbors.

## 3. Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training. It's particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

### 3.1 Self-Training Methods

- **Self-Training**: Uses initial labeled data to train a model, then iteratively adds confidently predicted unlabeled examples to training set.
- **Co-Training**: Uses multiple views of data where each view trains a separate classifier, and classifiers teach each other.

### 3.2 Graph-Based Methods

- **Label Propagation**: Propagates labels through a graph where nodes represent data points and edges represent similarities.
- **Label Spreading**: Similar to label propagation but allows initially labeled points to change their labels.

### 3.3 Generative Methods

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning learns optimal actions through trial and error by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

### 4.1 Value-Based Methods

These methods estimate the value of being in a particular state or taking a particular action.

#### Temporal Difference Learning

- **SARSA**: On-policy algorithm that updates Q-values based on the action actually taken by the current policy.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Uses deep neural networks to approximate Q-values for high-dimensional state spaces.

#### Dynamic Programming

- **Policy Iteration**: Alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement steps.

### 4.2 Policy-Based Methods

These methods directly optimize the policy without explicitly maintaining value functions.

- **Actor-Critic**: Combines value-based and policy-based methods where actor updates policy and critic estimates value function.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Constrains policy updates to prevent large changes that could harm performance.

### 4.3 Model-Based Methods

These methods learn a model of the environment and use it for planning.

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Uses random simulations to evaluate potential moves, famous for its success in game playing.
- **Dyna-Q**: Combines Q-learning with planning by learning a model of the environment and using it to generate simulated experiences.

### 4.4 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Handles scenarios with multiple learning agents.

- **Independent Q-Learning**: Each agent learns independently using Q-learning, treating other agents as part of the environment.

## 5. Learning Paradigms

### 5.1 Batch vs Online Learning

- Explicit model construction phase
- Predictions based on learned model parameters
- Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

**Key Differences:**

- **Training Speed**: Instance-based is faster to train, model-based is faster to predict
