## Kurtosis

### What is Kurtosis?

**Kurtosis** is the **4th statistical moment** in probability theory and statistics. The term comes from the Greek word meaning "curved, arching" and is a measure of the **"tailedness"** of a probability distribution.

Like skewness, kurtosis describes a particular aspect of a probability distribution, specifically how much probability mass is concentrated in the tails compared to a normal distribution.

### Formula

The kurtosis of a distribution is calculated using the fourth moment about the mean:

```
Kurtosis = E[(X - μ)⁴] / σ⁴
```

Where:

- E = Expected value
- X = Random variable
- μ = Mean
- σ = Standard deviation

### Practical Use Case in Finance

**Kurtosis risk** refers to the risk associated with the possibility of extreme outcomes or "fat tails" in the distribution of returns of a particular asset or portfolio.

**Key Points:**

- **High kurtosis** = Higher likelihood of extreme events (positive or negative)
- **Financial implications**: Greater probability of large losses or gains
- **Investment strategy**: Investors may need to adjust strategies to account for kurtosis risk

## Excess Kurtosis & Types

### What is Excess Kurtosis?

**Excess kurtosis** measures how much more peaked or flat a distribution is compared to a normal distribution. It's calculated by **subtracting 3** from the sample kurtosis coefficient.

```
Excess Kurtosis = Kurtosis - 3
```

### Types of Kurtosis

#### 1. Leptokurtic (Positive Excess Kurtosis)

- **Characteristic**: Positive excess kurtosis
- **Shape**: Fatter tails, more peaked center
- **Meaning**: More extreme values or outliers
- **Etymology**: "Lepto-" means "slender"

**Financial Example:**
Assets with positive excess kurtosis are **riskier and more volatile** than normal distribution assets. They may experience sudden price movements resulting in significant gains or losses.

#### 2. Platykurtic (Negative Excess Kurtosis)

- **Characteristic**: Negative excess kurtosis
- **Shape**: Thinner tails, flatter center
- **Meaning**: Fewer extreme values or outliers
- **Etymology**: "Platy-" means "broad"

**Financial Example:**
Assets with negative excess kurtosis are **less risky and less volatile** than normal distribution assets. They experience more gradual price movements with lower probability of large gains or losses.

#### 3. Mesokurtic (Zero Excess Kurtosis)

- **Characteristic**: Zero excess kurtosis
- **Shape**: Same "peakedness" as normal distribution
- **Example**: Normal distribution family (regardless of parameters)

**Financial Example:**
In finance, a mesokurtic distribution is considered **ideal for assets or portfolios** as it represents a balance between risk and return.

## Testing for Normality

### How to Determine if a Distribution is Normal

#### 1. Visual Inspection

**Method**: Examine histogram or density plot

- **Normal characteristic**: Bell-shaped curve
- **Pattern**: Majority of data in the middle, symmetric tapering tails
- **Assessment**: If approximately bell-shaped → likely normal

#### 2. QQ Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)

**Method**: Create normal probability plot

- **Process**: Plot observed data against expected normal distribution values
- **Interpretation**: If data points fall along straight line → likely normal
- **Advantage**: Visual assessment of normality

#### 3. Statistical Tests

**Available Tests:**

- **Shapiro-Wilk test**
- **Anderson-Darling test**
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**

**Process:**

1. Compare observed data to expected normal distribution values
2. Generate p-value
3. **Interpretation**: p-value < 0.05 → data is NOT normal

## QQ Plots

### What is a QQ Plot?

A **QQ plot (quantile-quantile plot)** is a graphical tool used to assess the similarity between two data distributions. It's particularly useful for determining whether data follows a normal distribution.

### How QQ Plots Work

**Construction:**

1. **X-axis**: Quantiles of one dataset (often theoretical normal distribution)
2. **Y-axis**: Quantiles of the other dataset (observed data)
3. **Interpretation**:
   - **Straight line** = Same distribution
   - **Deviation from line** = Different distributions

### Python Implementation

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create QQ plot
sm.qqplot(data, line='s')
plt.show()
```

**Reference**: [Statsmodels QQ Plot Documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.graphics.gofplots.qqplot.html)

### QQ Plot Interpretation Patterns

#### Perfect Normal Distribution

- Points fall exactly on straight diagonal line

#### Heavy Tails (Leptokurtic)

- Points curve above the line at both ends
- More extreme values than normal distribution

#### Light Tails (Platykurtic)

- Points curve below the line at both ends
- Fewer extreme values than normal distribution

#### Right Skewed

- Points curve above line on right, below on left
- Tail extends further to the right

#### Left Skewed

- Points curve below line on right, above on left
- Tail extends further to the left

### Does QQ Plot Only Detect Normal Distribution?

**No!** QQ plots can compare any two distributions:

- Normal vs. observed data (most common)
- Exponential vs. observed data
- Uniform vs. observed data
- Any theoretical distribution vs. observed data

## Uniform Distribution

### What is Uniform Distribution?

A **uniform distribution** is a probability distribution where **all outcomes are equally likely** within a given range. Every value in the specified range has the same probability of occurrence.

### Types of Uniform Distribution

#### 1. Continuous Uniform Distribution

**Notation**: X ~ U(a, b)

- **Range**: [a, b] where a and b are real numbers
- **Characteristic**: Equal probability density across entire range

#### 2. Discrete Uniform Distribution

**Notation**: X ~ DU(a, b)

- **Range**: {a, a+1, a+2, ..., b} where a and b are integers
- **Characteristic**: Equal probability for each discrete value

### Examples of Continuous Uniform Distribution

1. **Height**: Person randomly selected from group with heights ranging 5'6" to 6'0"
2. **Production time**: Machine producing products in 5-10 minutes
3. **Travel distance**: Car traveling 300-400 miles on one tank
4. **Weight**: Apple weighing between 100-200 grams

### Mathematical Properties

#### Probability Density Function (PDF)

```
f(x) = 1/(b-a)  for a ≤ x ≤ b
f(x) = 0        elsewhere
```

#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

```
F(x) = 0           for x < a
F(x) = (x-a)/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b
F(x) = 1           for x > b
```

#### Key Statistics

## Log-Normal Distribution

### What is Log-Normal Distribution?

A **log-normal distribution** is a heavy-tailed continuous probability distribution where the **logarithm of the random variable is normally distributed**.

**Key Relationship**: If X is log-normally distributed, then ln(X) is normally distributed.

### Real-World Examples

1. **Internet forums**: Length of comments posted
2. **Online articles**: Users' dwell time on content (jokes, news, etc.)
3. **Chess games**: Game duration tends to follow log-normal distribution
4. **Economics**: Income distribution of 97%-99% of population

### Mathematical Properties

#### Notation

```
X ~ LogNormal(μ, σ²)
```

Where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ln(X).

#### Probability Density Function (PDF)

```
f(x) = (1/(x·σ·√(2π))) · e^(-(ln(x)-μ)²/(2σ²))  for x > 0
f(x) = 0  for x ≤ 0
```

#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

```
F(x) = Φ((ln(x) - μ)/σ)
```

Where Φ is the standard normal CDF.

#### Key Statistics

- **Mean**: e^(μ + σ²/2)
- **Variance**: (e^(σ²) - 1) · e^(2μ + σ²)
- **Skewness**: Always positive (right-skewed)

### How to Check if Data is Log-Normally Distributed

## Pareto Distribution

### What is Pareto Distribution?

The **Pareto distribution** is a probability distribution commonly used to model quantities that exhibit **power-law behavior**, such as wealth distribution, income distribution, and other phenomena following the "80-20 rule."

### Historical Context

**Vilfredo Pareto** originally used this distribution to describe:

- **Wealth allocation**: Larger portion of wealth owned by smaller percentage of people
- **Income distribution**: Similar power-law patterns in income
- **Pareto Principle**: "80-20 rule" - 20% of population controls 80% of wealth

### Power Law Relationship

**Mathematical Definition**: A power law is a functional relationship where one variable is proportional to a power of another:

```
y = k · x^a
```

Where:

- k = constant
- a = power/exponent
- x, y = variables

### Mathematical Properties

#### Parameters

- **x_m**: Scale parameter (minimum value)
- **α (alpha)**: Shape parameter (controls tail behavior)

#### Notation

```
X ~ Pareto(α, x_m)
```

#### Probability Density Function (PDF)

```
f(x) = (α · x_m^α) / x^(α+1)  for x ≥ x_m
f(x) = 0  for x < x_m
```

#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

```
F(x) = 1 - (x_m/x)^α  for x ≥ x_m
```

#### Key Statistics

- **Mean**: α·x_m/(α-1) for α > 1
- **Variance**: (x_m²·α)/((α-1)²·(α-2)) for α > 2
- **Skewness**: Always positive (heavy right tail)

### Real-World Examples

1. **Human settlements**: Few large cities, many small hamlets/villages
2. **Internet traffic**: File size distribution using TCP protocol (many small files, few large ones)
3. **Wealth distribution**: Small percentage owns large percentage of wealth
4. **Income distribution**: Power-law pattern in income levels
5. **City populations**: Few megacities, many small towns

### How to Detect Pareto Distribution

#### Method 1: Log-Log Plot

1. Create log-log plot of data
2. **Pareto characteristic**: Should show straight line
3. **Slope**: Related to α parameter

#### Method 2: Rank-Size Plot

1. Rank data from largest to smallest
2. Plot rank vs. size on log-log scale
3. **Linear relationship**: Indicates Pareto distribution

#### Method 3: Statistical Tests

1. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**: Compare with theoretical Pareto
2. **Maximum likelihood estimation**: Estimate parameters
3. **Goodness-of-fit tests**: Assess fit quality

#### Method 4: Visual Inspection

- **Heavy right tail**: Long tail extending far to the right
- **Power-law decay**: Probability decreases as power of x
- **"80-20" pattern**: Small portion accounts for large effect

## Transformations

### Why Use Transformations?

**Purpose**: Convert non-normal distributions into approximately normal distributions to:

- Meet assumptions of statistical tests
- Improve model performance
- Stabilize variance
- Reduce skewness

### Common Transformation Techniques

#### 1. Logarithmic Transformation

**Usage**: Right-skewed data, log-normal distributions

```
Y = ln(X)  or  Y = log₁₀(X)
```

**Effect**: Compresses large values, expands small values

#### 2. Square Root Transformation

**Usage**: Moderately right-skewed data, count data

```
Y = √X
```

**Effect**: Less aggressive than log transformation

#### 3. Box-Cox Transformation

**Usage**: General power transformations

```
Y = (X^λ - 1)/λ  for λ ≠ 0
Y = ln(X)        for λ = 0
```

**Advantage**: Automatically finds optimal λ parameter

#### 4. Reciprocal Transformation

**Usage**: Highly right-skewed data

```
Y = 1/X
```

**Effect**: Strong compression of large values

#### 5. Arcsin Transformation

**Usage**: Proportion data (0 to 1)

```
Y = arcsin(√X)
```

**Effect**: Stabilizes variance for proportions

### Choosing the Right Transformation

#### Decision Framework:

1. **Assess skewness**: Determine direction and magnitude
2. **Try transformations**: Start with log, then square root
3. **Check normality**: Use QQ plots and statistical tests
4. **Validate results**: Ensure transformation makes sense for domain

#### Guidelines:

- **Moderate right skew**: Square root transformation
- **Strong right skew**: Log transformation
- **Very strong right skew**: Reciprocal transformation
- **Left skew**: Try squaring or cubing
- **Proportions**: Arcsin transformation
