# Descriptive Statistics Session 3 - Probability Distributions Guide

## Random Variables

### What are Algebraic Variables?

In Algebra, a variable (like x) is an unknown value that can be solved for or manipulated mathematically.

### What are Random Variables in Statistics and Probability?

A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment. Unlike algebraic variables, random variables represent outcomes that are subject to chance and uncertainty.

### Types of Random Variables

#### 1. Discrete Random Variables

- Can only take specific, countable values
- Examples: Number of heads in coin flips, number of students in a class, dice outcomes
- Values are typically integers with gaps between them

#### 2. Continuous Random Variables

- Can take any value within a range or interval
- Examples: Height, weight, temperature, time
- Values form a continuous spectrum with no gaps

## Probability Distributions

### What are Probability Distributions?

A probability distribution is a list of all possible outcomes of a random variable along with their corresponding probability values. It describes how probabilities are distributed over the values of the random variable.

### Problem with Distribution Tables

In many scenarios, creating tables for probability distributions becomes problematic because:

1. **Large number of outcomes**: The number of outcomes can be much larger, making tables tedious to write
2. **Infinite outcomes**: Some variables have infinite possible outcomes (e.g., height of people, rolling 10 dice together)
3. **Impractical representation**: Tables become unwieldy for complex scenarios

### Solution: Mathematical Functions

Instead of tables, we use mathematical functions to model the relationship between outcomes and their probabilities. This approach is more elegant and practical for complex distributions.

**Note**: Probability Distribution and Probability Distribution Functions are often used interchangeably in practice.

### Types of Probability Distributions

#### 1. Discrete Probability Distributions

- Used for discrete random variables
- Examples: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Geometric

#### 2. Continuous Probability Distributions

- Used for continuous random variables
- Examples: Normal, Log-normal, Exponential, Uniform

### Famous Probability Distributions

Some well-known distributions include:

- **Normal Distribution** (Bell curve)
- **Binomial Distribution**
- **Poisson Distribution**
- **Exponential Distribution**
- **Uniform Distribution**
- **Bernoulli Distribution**

## Why are Probability Distributions Important?

### 1. Understanding Data Shape

Probability distributions give us an idea about the shape and distribution of our data, helping us understand:

- Central tendency
- Variability
- Skewness
- Kurtosis

### 2. Leveraging Known Properties

If our data follows a famous distribution, we automatically know a lot about the data, including:

- Expected behavior
- Statistical properties
- Appropriate analysis methods
- Prediction capabilities

## Parameters in Probability Distributions

### Definition

Parameters in probability distributions are numerical values that determine the shape, location, and scale of the distribution.

### Characteristics of Parameters

- **Shape**: How the distribution curves (e.g., bell-shaped, skewed)
- **Location**: Where the distribution is centered
- **Scale**: How spread out the distribution is

### Importance

Different probability distributions have different sets of parameters, and understanding these parameters is essential for:

- Statistical analysis
- Statistical inference
- Model fitting
- Prediction and forecasting

## Probability Distribution Functions

### Definition

A probability distribution function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the probability of obtaining different values of a random variable in a particular probability distribution.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

### Definition

PMF stands for Probability Mass Function. It is a mathematical function that describes the probability distribution of a **discrete random variable**.

### Properties of PMF

The PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the random variable and must satisfy two conditions:

1. **Non-negativity**: The probability assigned to each value must be non-negative (≥ 0)
2. **Normalization**: The sum of probabilities assigned to all possible values must equal 1

### Mathematical Representation

For a discrete random variable X:

- P(X = x) = probability that X takes value x
- ∑ P(X = x) = 1 (sum over all possible values)

### Examples of Distributions with PMF

- **Bernoulli Distribution**: Models single trial with two outcomes
- **Binomial Distribution**: Models number of successes in fixed number of trials

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for Discrete Variables

### Definition

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) F(x) describes the probability that a random variable X will be found at a value less than or equal to x.

### Mathematical Formula

**F(x) = P(X ≤ x)**

### Properties of CDF

- Always non-decreasing
- F(-∞) = 0
- F(+∞) = 1
- Right-continuous

### Relationship with PMF

For discrete variables: F(x) = ∑ P(X = k) for all k ≤ x

### Examples

- Bernoulli Distribution CDF
- Binomial Distribution CDF

## Probability Density Function (PDF)

### Definition

PDF stands for Probability Density Function. It is a mathematical function that describes the probability distribution of a **continuous random variable**.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Why "Density" and not "Probability"?

For continuous variables, the probability of any exact value is zero. Instead, we talk about probability density, which represents the relative likelihood of values in different regions.

#### 2. What does the Area Under the Curve Represent?

The area under the PDF curve represents probability:

- Total area under the curve = 1
- Area between two points = probability of the variable falling in that range

#### 3. How to Calculate Probability?

For continuous variables, probability is calculated as the area under the PDF curve between two points:
**P(a < X < b) = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx**

### Examples of Continuous Distributions

- **Normal Distribution**: Bell-shaped, symmetric
- **Log-normal Distribution**: Right-skewed
- **Exponential Distribution**: Decaying exponential shape

### Graph Calculation

PDF graphs are calculated using:

- Mathematical formulas specific to each distribution
- Parameters that determine shape and location
- Integration to find probabilities

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for Continuous Variables

### Definition

For continuous random variables, the CDF is the integral of the PDF:
**F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∫[-∞ to x] f(t) dt**

### Properties

- Smooth, continuous curve
- Always increasing
- Derivative of CDF = PDF

## Density Estimation

### What is Density Estimation?

Density estimation is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable based on a set of observations or data. It involves estimating the underlying distribution of a dataset.

### Applications of Density Estimation

- **Hypothesis testing**
- **Data analysis**
- **Data visualization**
- **Machine learning**: Estimating probability distributions of input data
- **Modeling likelihood** of events or outcomes

### Types of Density Estimation Methods

#### 1. Parametric Methods

- Assume data follows a specific probability distribution
- Estimate parameters of the known distribution
- Examples: Assuming normal distribution and estimating mean and variance

#### 2. Non-parametric Methods

- Do not assume a specific distribution
- Estimate distribution directly from data
- More flexible but computationally intensive

## Parametric Density Estimation

### Definition

Parametric density estimation is a method of estimating the PDF by assuming that the underlying distribution belongs to a specific parametric family of probability distributions.

### Common Parametric Families

- **Normal Distribution**: Characterized by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)
- **Exponential Distribution**: Characterized by rate parameter (λ)
- **Poisson Distribution**: Characterized by rate parameter (λ)

### Process

1. Choose a parametric family based on data characteristics
2. Estimate parameters using methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation
3. Use the fitted distribution for analysis and prediction

### Advantages

- Efficient with small datasets
- Well-understood mathematical properties
- Easy to interpret and communicate

### Disadvantages

- May not fit data well if wrong distribution is assumed
- Limited flexibility

## Non-Parametric Density Estimation (KDE)

### When to Use Non-Parametric Methods

Non-parametric density estimation is used when:

- The distribution is not clear
- Data doesn't follow any famous distribution
- More flexibility is needed

### Definition

Non-parametric density estimation estimates the PDF without making assumptions about the underlying distribution. It constructs an estimate using available data directly.

### Advantages

- **Flexibility**: No assumption of specific distribution required
- **Accuracy**: More accurate when underlying distribution is unknown or complex
- **Adaptability**: Can handle multimodal and complex distributions

### Disadvantages

- **Computational intensity**: Requires more computational resources
- **Data requirements**: May need more data for accurate estimates
- **Parameter selection**: Requires choosing bandwidth and kernel parameters

## Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

### Definition

KDE is a non-parametric technique that uses a kernel function to smooth out the data and create a continuous estimate of the underlying density function.

### How KDE Works

1. **Place kernels**: Put a kernel (usually Gaussian) at each data point
2. **Sum kernels**: Add all kernel functions together
3. **Normalize**: Ensure the result integrates to 1
4. **Smooth estimate**: Result is a smooth density estimate

### Key Components

- **Kernel function**: Usually Gaussian (normal) distribution
- **Bandwidth**: Controls the smoothness of the estimate
  - Large bandwidth: Smoother, may miss details
  - Small bandwidth: More detailed, may be noisy

### Mathematical Formula

**f̂(x) = (1/nh) ∑[i=1 to n] K((x - xi)/h)**

Where:

- n = number of data points
- h = bandwidth
- K = kernel function
- xi = data points
