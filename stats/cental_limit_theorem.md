## Bernoulli Distribution

### What is Bernoulli Distribution?

The **Bernoulli distribution** is a probability distribution that models a **binary outcome**, where the outcome can be either:

- **Success** (represented by value 1)
- **Failure** (represented by value 0)

**Historical Context**: Named after Swiss mathematician **Jacob Bernoulli**, who first introduced it in the late 1600s.

### Mathematical Properties

#### Parameters

- **p**: Probability of success (0 ≤ p ≤ 1)
- **1-p**: Probability of failure

#### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

```
P(X = x) = p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)  for x ∈ {0, 1}
```

**Simplified:**

- P(X = 1) = p (probability of success)
- P(X = 0) = 1-p (probability of failure)

#### Key Statistics

- **Mean (μ)**: p
- **Variance (σ²)**: p(1-p)
- **Standard Deviation (σ)**: √[p(1-p)]

### Applications in Machine Learning

#### 1. Binary Classification Problems

**Examples:**

- Customer purchase prediction (buy/don't buy)
- Email classification (spam/not spam)
- Medical diagnosis (disease/no disease)
- Click prediction (click/no click)

#### 2. Modeling Binary Outcomes

- **Logistic Regression**: Output follows Bernoulli distribution
- **Binary Neural Networks**: Each output node represents Bernoulli trial
- **A/B Testing**: Success/failure outcomes

#### 3. Feature Engineering

- **Binary features**: Converting categorical to binary
- **Threshold-based features**: Above/below threshold decisions

## Binomial Distribution

### What is Binomial Distribution?

The **Binomial distribution** describes the **number of successes** in a **fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials** with two possible outcomes, where the probability of success remains constant for each trial.

### Parameters

- **n**: Number of trials (fixed)
- **p**: Probability of success (constant across trials)

### Mathematical Properties

#### Probability Density Function (PDF)

```
P(X = k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
```

Where:

- **C(n,k)** = n!/(k!(n-k)!) (combination formula)
- **k** = number of successes (0 ≤ k ≤ n)

#### Key Statistics

- **Mean (μ)**: np
- **Variance (σ²)**: np(1-p)
- **Standard Deviation (σ)**: √[np(1-p)]

### Criteria for Binomial Distribution

1. **Fixed number of trials**: The process consists of n trials
2. **Binary outcomes**: Only 2 exclusive outcomes possible (success/failure)
3. **Constant probability**: P(success) = p and P(failure) = 1-p (fixed across trials)
4. **Independence**: All trials are independent of each other

### Example Problem

**Scenario**: Probability of anyone watching a lecture and liking it is 0.5. For 3 people, what's the probability that:

#### 1. No one likes it (k = 0)

```
P(X = 0) = C(3,0) * (0.5)^0 * (0.5)^3 = 1 * 1 * 0.125 = 0.125
```

#### 2. 1 person likes it (k = 1)

```
P(X = 1) = C(3,1) * (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^2 = 3 * 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.375
```

#### 3. 2 people like it (k = 2)

```
P(X = 2) = C(3,2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^1 = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.375
```

#### 4. All 3 people like it (k = 3)

```
P(X = 3) = C(3,3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^0 = 1 * 0.125 * 1 = 0.125
```

## Sampling Distribution

### What is Sampling Distribution?

**Sampling distribution** is a probability distribution that describes the statistical properties of a **sample statistic** (such as sample mean or sample proportion) computed from **multiple independent samples** of the same size from a population.

### Key Concepts

#### Sample Statistic

Any numerical summary computed from a sample:

- **Sample mean** (x̄)
- **Sample proportion** (p̂)
- **Sample variance** (s²)
- **Sample standard deviation** (s)

#### Process of Creating Sampling Distribution

1. **Draw multiple samples** of size n from population
2. **Calculate statistic** for each sample (e.g., mean)
3. **Create distribution** of these statistics
4. **Analyze properties** of this distribution

### Why is Sampling Distribution Important?

#### 1. Estimate Variability

**Purpose**: Understand how much sample statistics vary

- **Precision**: How close sample statistic is to population parameter
- **Reliability**: Consistency across different samples
- **Standard error**: Measure of sampling variability

#### 2. Statistical Inference

**Applications**:

- **Confidence intervals**: Range of plausible values for population parameter
- **Hypothesis testing**: Compare sample results to theoretical expectations
- **Prediction**: Make forecasts about population based on sample data

#### 3. Quality Assessment

**Benefits**:

- **Sample size determination**: How large should sample be?
- **Bias detection**: Is sampling method producing consistent results?
- **Method validation**: Are statistical techniques appropriate?

### Properties of Sampling Distributions

#### Central Tendency

- **Mean of sampling distribution** ≈ Population parameter (unbiased estimator)

#### Variability

- **Standard error** = σ/√n (decreases as sample size increases)

#### Shape

- **Approaches normality** as sample size increases (Central Limit Theorem)

## Central Limit Theorem

### What is the Central Limit Theorem?

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that the **distribution of sample means** from a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will **approach a normal distribution**, regardless of the underlying distribution of the variables.

### Mathematical Statement

If X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent and identically distributed random variables with mean μ and variance σ², then:

```
Sample Mean: X̄ = (X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ)/n

As n → ∞: X̄ ~ N(μ, σ²/n)
```

### Conditions Required for CLT

#### 1. Sample Size

- **Large enough**: Typically n ≥ 30
- **Rule of thumb**: Larger samples → better normal approximation
- **Exception**: If population is already normal, any sample size works

#### 2. Population Constraints

- **Finite population**: Or infinite population with finite variance
- **Finite variance**: σ² < ∞ (no infinite variability)

#### 3. Independence and Identical Distribution

- **Independent**: Each observation doesn't affect others
- **Identically distributed**: All observations come from same distribution
- **Random sampling**: Ensures these conditions are met

### Key Implications

#### 1. Universal Applicability

**Remarkable Property**: Works regardless of original distribution shape

- **Skewed distributions** → Normal sampling distribution
- **Multimodal distributions** → Normal sampling distribution
- **Uniform distributions** → Normal sampling distribution

#### 2. Predictable Properties

**Sampling Distribution of Means**:

- **Mean**: μₓ̄ = μ (same as population mean)
- **Standard Error**: σₓ̄ = σ/√n (decreases with larger n)
- **Shape**: Approximately normal for large n

### Importance in Statistics and Machine Learning

#### 1. Statistical Inference Foundation

**Applications**:

- **Confidence intervals**: Construct ranges for population parameters
- **Hypothesis testing**: Compare sample results to theoretical values
- **Population predictions**: Estimate population characteristics from samples

#### 2. Theoretical Justification

**Statistical Techniques**:

- **T-tests**: Compare means between groups
- **ANOVA**: Analysis of variance across multiple groups
- **Linear regression**: Assumption of normally distributed residuals

#### 3. Quality Control

**Business Applications**:

- **Process monitoring**: Detect when processes go out of control
- **Sampling inspection**: Determine if batches meet quality standards
- **Risk assessment**: Estimate probabilities of extreme events

### Practical Guidelines

#### Sample Size Rules

- **n ≥ 30**: General rule for most distributions
- **n ≥ 50**: For heavily skewed distributions
- **n ≥ 100**: For very skewed or unusual distributions

#### Checking Assumptions

1. **Independence**: Random sampling, no autocorrelation
2. **Identical distribution**: Same population for all observations
3. **Finite variance**: No extreme outliers or infinite variability

### Case Study 2: Average Income of Indians

#### Objective

Estimate the average income of Indians using Central Limit Theorem principles.

#### Step-by-Step Process

##### Step 1: Data Collection

**Requirements**:

- Collect multiple random samples of salaries
- Representative group of Indians
- Each sample size n > 30 (CLT requirement)
- Ensure samples are unbiased and representative

##### Step 2: Calculate Sample Statistics

**For each sample**:

- **Sample mean**: x̄ᵢ = (Σxⱼ)/n
- **Sample standard deviation**: sᵢ = √[(Σ(xⱼ - x̄ᵢ)²)/(n-1)]

##### Step 3: Estimate Population Mean

**Calculate**:

- **Average of sample means**: μ̂ = (Σx̄ᵢ)/k (where k = number of samples)
- This provides best estimate of population mean

##### Step 4: Calculate Standard Error

**Formula**:

```
Standard Error = σₓ̄ = s/√k
```

Where s is standard deviation of sample means

##### Step 5: Construct Confidence Interval

**For 95% confidence interval**:

```
Lower limit = μ̂ - 1.96 × SE
Upper limit = μ̂ + 1.96 × SE
```

**Interpretation**: 95% confident that true population mean falls within this range

##### Step 6: Report Results

**Final Output**:

- Estimated average income
- Confidence interval
- Sample size and methodology details
- Limitations and assumptions

#### Python Implementation Framework

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Step 1: Collect samples (example structure)
samples = [sample1, sample2, sample3, ...]  # List of income samples

# Step 2: Calculate sample means
sample_means = [np.mean(sample) for sample in samples]

# Step 3: Estimate population mean
population_mean_estimate = np.mean(sample_means)

# Step 4: Calculate standard error
standard_error = np.std(sample_means) / np.sqrt(len(sample_means))

# Step 5: Confidence interval
confidence_level = 0.95
alpha = 1 - confidence_level
z_critical = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)

margin_of_error = z_critical * standard_error
lower_bound = population_mean_estimate - margin_of_error
upper_bound = population_mean_estimate + margin_of_error

# Step 6: Report results
print(f"Estimated Average Income: {population_mean_estimate:.2f}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: [{lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f}]")
```

#### Important Considerations

**Data Quality Factors**:
