## Bernoulli Distribution

### What is Bernoulli Distribution?

The **Bernoulli distribution** is a probability distribution that models a **binary outcome**, where the outcome can be either:

- **Success** (represented by value 1)
- **Failure** (represented by value 0)

**Historical Context**: Named after Swiss mathematician **Jacob Bernoulli**, who first introduced it in the late 1600s.

### Mathematical Properties

#### Parameters

- **p**: Probability of success (0 ≤ p ≤ 1)
- **1-p**: Probability of failure

#### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

```
P(X = x) = p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)  for x ∈ {0, 1}
```

**Simplified:**

- P(X = 1) = p (probability of success)
- P(X = 0) = 1-p (probability of failure)

#### Key Statistics

**Mean (μ):**

```
μ = E[X] = p
```

**Variance (σ²):**

```
σ² = Var(X) = p(1-p)
```

**Standard Deviation (σ):**

```
σ = √[p(1-p)]
```

**Derivation of Mean:**

```
E[X] = 0 × P(X = 0) + 1 × P(X = 1)
     = 0 × (1-p) + 1 × p
     = p
```

**Derivation of Variance:**

```
E[X²] = 0² × P(X = 0) + 1² × P(X = 1) = p
Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])² = p - p² = p(1-p)
```

### Applications in Machine Learning

## Binomial Distribution

### What is Binomial Distribution?

The **Binomial distribution** describes the **number of successes** in a **fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials** with two possible outcomes, where the probability of success remains constant for each trial.

### Parameters

- **n**: Number of trials (fixed)
- **p**: Probability of success (constant across trials)

### Mathematical Properties

#### Probability Density Function (PDF)

```
P(X = k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
```

Where:

- **C(n,k)** = n!/(k!(n-k)!) (combination formula)
- **k** = number of successes (0 ≤ k ≤ n)

#### Key Statistics

**Mean (μ):**

```
μ = E[X] = np
```

**Variance (σ²):**

```
σ² = Var(X) = np(1-p)
```

**Standard Deviation (σ):**

```
σ = √[np(1-p)]
```

**Derivation of Mean:**

```
E[X] = E[X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ]
     = E[X₁] + E[X₂] + ... + E[Xₙ]  (linearity of expectation)
     = p + p + ... + p  (n times)
     = np
```

**Derivation of Variance:**

```
Var(X) = Var(X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ)
       = Var(X₁) + Var(X₂) + ... + Var(Xₙ)  (independence)
       = p(1-p) + p(1-p) + ... + p(1-p)  (n times)
       = np(1-p)
```

### Criteria for Binomial Distribution

1. **Fixed number of trials**: The process consists of n trials
2. **Binary outcomes**: Only 2 exclusive outcomes possible (success/failure)
3. **Constant probability**: P(success) = p and P(failure) = 1-p (fixed across trials)
4. **Independence**: All trials are independent of each other

### Example Problem

**Scenario**: Probability of anyone watching a lecture and liking it is 0.5. For 3 people, what's the probability that:

#### 1. No one likes it (k = 0)

```
P(X = 0) = C(3,0) * (0.5)^0 * (0.5)^3 = 1 * 1 * 0.125 = 0.125
```

#### 2. 1 person likes it (k = 1)

```
P(X = 1) = C(3,1) * (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^2 = 3 * 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.375
```

#### 3. 2 people like it (k = 2)

```
P(X = 2) = C(3,2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^1 = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.375
```

#### 4. All 3 people like it (k = 3)

```
P(X = 3) = C(3,3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^0 = 1 * 0.125 * 1 = 0.125
```

## Poisson Distribution

### What is Poisson Distribution?

The **Poisson distribution** models the **number of events occurring** in a **fixed interval of time or space**, given that these events occur with a **known constant mean rate** and are **independent** of the time since the last event.

**Historical Context**: Named after French mathematician **Siméon Denis Poisson**, who published it in 1837.

### Mathematical Properties

#### Parameters

- **λ (lambda)**: Average rate of occurrence (λ > 0)
  - Also represents both the mean and variance of the distribution

#### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

```
P(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!
```

Where:

- **k** = number of events (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
- **e** ≈ 2.71828 (Euler's number)
- **k!** = factorial of k

#### Key Statistics

**Mean (μ):**

```
μ = E[X] = λ
```

**Variance (σ²):**

```
σ² = Var(X) = λ
```

**Standard Deviation (σ):**

```
σ = √λ
```

**Important Property**: In Poisson distribution, the mean equals the variance (μ = σ² = λ)

### Conditions for Poisson Distribution

1. **Constant Rate**: Events occur at a constant average rate λ
2. **Independence**: Occurrence of one event doesn't affect probability of another
3. **Rare Events**: Events are relatively rare in the given interval
4. **Fixed Interval**: Time or space interval is fixed
5. **Non-simultaneous**: Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant

### Relationship to Binomial Distribution

**Poisson Approximation to Binomial**: When n is large and p is small such that np = λ (constant):

```
Binomial(n, p) ≈ Poisson(λ) where λ = np
```

**Rule of thumb**: Use when n ≥ 100 and np ≤ 10

### Example Problems

#### Example 1: Call Center

**Scenario**: A call center receives an average of 3 calls per minute.

**Question**: What's the probability of receiving exactly 5 calls in the next minute?

**Solution**:

```
λ = 3 (calls per minute)
P(X = 5) = (3^5 * e^(-3)) / 5!
         = (243 * 0.0498) / 120
         = 0.101 or 10.1%
```

#### Example 2: Website Traffic

**Scenario**: A website receives 2 visitors per hour on average.

**Questions**:

1. **No visitors in the next hour**:

```
P(X = 0) = (2^0 * e^(-2)) / 0! = e^(-2) = 0.135 or 13.5%
```

2. **More than 3 visitors**:

```
P(X > 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 3) = 1 - [P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3)]
         = 1 - 0.857 = 0.143 or 14.3%
```

## Sampling Distribution

### What is Sampling Distribution?

**Sampling distribution** is a probability distribution that describes the statistical properties of a **sample statistic** (such as sample mean or sample proportion) computed from **multiple independent samples** of the same size from a population.

### Key Concepts

#### Sample Statistic

Any numerical summary computed from a sample:

- **Sample mean** (x̄)
- **Sample proportion** (p̂)
- **Sample variance** (s²)
- **Sample standard deviation** (s)

#### Mathematical Properties of Sampling Distribution

**For Sample Mean (x̄):**

**Mean of Sampling Distribution:**

```
μₓ̄ = E[x̄] = μ
```

**Variance of Sampling Distribution:**

```
σ²ₓ̄ = Var(x̄) = σ²/n
```

**Standard Error (Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution):**

```
σₓ̄ = σ/√n
```

**For Sample Proportion (p̂):**

**Mean of Sampling Distribution:**

```
μₚ̂ = E[p̂] = p
```

**Variance of Sampling Distribution:**

```
σ²ₚ̂ = Var(p̂) = p(1-p)/n
```

**Standard Error:**

```
σₚ̂ = √[p(1-p)/n]
```

#### Process of Creating Sampling Distribution

1. **Draw multiple samples** of size n from population
2. **Calculate statistic** for each sample (e.g., mean)
3. **Create distribution** of these statistics
4. **Analyze properties** of this distribution

### Why is Sampling Distribution Important?

#### 1. Estimate Variability

**Purpose**: Understand how much sample statistics vary

- **Reliability**: Consistency across different samples
- **Standard error**: Measure of sampling variability

#### 2. Statistical Inference

- **Method validation**: Are statistical techniques appropriate?

### Properties of Sampling Distributions

#### Central Tendency

- **Mean of sampling distribution** ≈ Population parameter (unbiased estimator)

#### Variability

- **Standard error** = σ/√n (decreases as sample size increases)

#### Shape

- **Approaches normality** as sample size increases (Central Limit Theorem)

## Central Limit Theorem

### What is the Central Limit Theorem?

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that the **distribution of sample means** from a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will **approach a normal distribution**, regardless of the underlying distribution of the variables.

### Mathematical Statement

If X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent and identically distributed random variables with mean μ and variance σ², then:

```
Sample Mean: x̄ = (X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ)/n

As n → ∞: x̄ ~ N(μ, σ²/n)
```

**Standardized Form:**

```
Z = (x̄ - μ)/(σ/√n) ~ N(0,1)
```

### Central Limit Theorem for Different Distributions

#### For Any Distribution

**Mean of Sample Mean:**

```
μₓ̄ = μ
```

**Standard Deviation of Sample Mean (Standard Error):**

```
σₓ̄ = σ/√n
```

#### For Binomial Distribution

When applying CLT to binomial distribution with parameters n and p:

**Sample Proportion:** p̂ = X/n (where X ~ Binomial(n,p))

**Mean:**

```
μₚ̂ = p
```

**Standard Error:**

```
σₚ̂ = √[p(1-p)/n]
```

**Normal Approximation:**

```
p̂ ~ N(p, p(1-p)/n) for large n
```

#### For Poisson Distribution

When applying CLT to Poisson distribution with parameter λ:

**Mean:**

```
μₓ̄ = λ
```

**Standard Error:**

```
σₓ̄ = √(λ/n)
```

### Conditions Required for CLT

#### 1. Sample Size

- **Large enough**: Typically n ≥ 30
- **Rule of thumb**: Larger samples → better normal approximation
- **Exception**: If population is already normal, any sample size works

#### 2. Population Constraints

- **Finite population**: Or infinite population with finite variance
- **Finite variance**: σ² < ∞ (no infinite variability)

#### 3. Independence and Identical Distribution

- **Independent**: Each observation doesn't affect others
- **Identically distributed**: All observations come from same distribution
- **Random sampling**: Ensures these conditions are met

### Key Implications

#### 1. Universal Applicability

**Remarkable Property**: Works regardless of original distribution shape

- **Skewed distributions** → Normal sampling distribution
- **Multimodal distributions** → Normal sampling distribution
- **Uniform distributions** → Normal sampling distribution

#### 2. Predictable Properties

**Sampling Distribution of Means**:

- **Mean**: μₓ̄ = μ (same as population mean)
- **Standard Error**: σₓ̄ = σ/√n (decreases with larger n)
- **Shape**: Approximately normal for large n

### Importance in Statistics and Machine Learning

#### 1. Statistical Inference Foundation

**Applications**:

- **Confidence intervals**: Construct ranges for population parameters
- **Hypothesis testing**: Compare sample results to theoretical values
- **Population predictions**: Estimate population characteristics from samples

#### 2. Theoretical Justification

- **Linear regression**: Assumption of normally distributed residuals

#### 3. Quality Control

**Business Applications**:

- **Sampling inspection**: Determine if batches meet quality standards
- **Risk assessment**: Estimate probabilities of extreme events

### Practical Guidelines

#### Sample Size Rules

- **n ≥ 30**: General rule for most distributions
- **n ≥ 50**: For heavily skewed distributions
- **n ≥ 100**: For very skewed or unusual distributions

#### Checking Assumptions

1. **Independence**: Random sampling, no autocorrelation
2. **Identical distribution**: Same population for all observations
3. **Finite variance**: No extreme outliers or infinite variability
