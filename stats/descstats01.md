# Complete Guide to Descriptive Statistics

## What is Statistics?

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves **collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting data**. It provides tools and methods to understand and make sense of large amounts of data and to draw conclusions and make decisions based on the data.

## Types of Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics deals with the **collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data**. It focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a set of data, without making inferences or predictions about the larger population.

### 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics deals with **making conclusions and predictions about a population based on a sample**. It involves:

- Use of probability theory to estimate likelihood of events
- Hypothesis testing to determine if claims about population are supported
- Regression analysis to examine relationships between variables

## Population vs Sample

### Population

**Population** refers to the entire group of individuals or objects that we are interested in studying. It is the complete set of observations that we want to make inferences about.

**Examples:**

- All cricket fans
- All students in a school
- All cars in a city

### Sample

A **sample** is a subset of the population. It is a smaller group of individuals or objects that we select from the population to study.

**Examples:**

- Cricket fans present in the stadium
- Students who visit college for lectures
- 100 randomly selected students

### Things to Consider When Creating Samples

1. **Sample Size** - Must be adequate for reliable results
2. **Random** - Selection should be unbiased
3. **Representative** - Should reflect population characteristics

### Parameter vs Statistics

- **Parameter**: A characteristic of a **population** (generally unknown)
- **Statistic**: A characteristic of a **sample** (used to estimate parameters)

## Inferential Statistics Topics

1. **Hypothesis Testing** - Testing hypotheses about population parameters
2. **Confidence Intervals** - Estimating range of values for population parameters
3. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** - Comparing means across multiple groups
4. **Regression Analysis** - Modeling relationships between variables
5. **Chi-square Tests** - Testing independence between categorical variables
6. **Sampling Techniques** - Ensuring representative samples
7. **Bayesian Statistics** - Updating beliefs based on new evidence

## Types of Data

Data can be classified into different types based on their characteristics:

### 1. Categorical Data

- **Nominal**: Categories with no natural order (e.g., colors, gender)
- **Ordinal**: Categories with natural order (e.g., ratings, education levels)

### 2. Numerical Data

- **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of children)
- **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight)

## Measures of Central Tendency

A **measure of central tendency** is a statistical measure that represents a typical or central value for a dataset.

### 1. Mean (Arithmetic Average)

The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

**Formula:**

```
Mean (x̄) = (x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + ... + xₙ) / n
```

**Mathematical Notation:**

```
x̄ = Σx / n
```

Where:

- x̄ = sample mean
- Σx = sum of all values
- n = number of observations

### 2. Median

The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending order.

**For odd number of values:**

```
Median = Middle value
```

**For even number of values:**

```
Median = (n/2 term + (n/2 + 1) term) / 2
```

### 3. Mode

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.

- **Unimodal**: One mode
- **Bimodal**: Two modes
- **Multimodal**: More than two modes

### 4. Weighted Mean

Used when values have different importance or frequency.

**Formula:**

```
Weighted Mean = Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) / Σwᵢ
```

Where:

- xᵢ = individual values
- wᵢ = corresponding weights

### 5. Trimmed Mean

Calculated by removing a certain percentage of smallest and largest values, then taking the mean of remaining values.

**Steps:**

1. Arrange data in ascending order
2. Remove specified percentage from both ends
3. Calculate mean of remaining values

## Measures of Dispersion

**Measure of dispersion** describes the spread or variability of a dataset around the central tendency.

### 1. Range

The difference between maximum and minimum values.

**Formula:**

```
Range = Maximum value - Minimum value
```

### 2. Variance

The average of squared differences from the mean.

**Population Variance:**

```
σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / N
```

**Sample Variance:**

```
s² = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² / (n-1)
```

**Example Calculation:**

| X   | X - Mean | (X - Mean)² |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 3   | 0        | 0           |
| 2   | -1       | 1           |
| 1   | -2       | 4           |
| 5   | 2        | 4           |
| 4   | 1        | 1           |

Variance = 10/5 = 2

### 3. Standard Deviation

The square root of variance.

**Formula:**

```
Standard Deviation (σ or s) = √Variance
```

### 4. Coefficient of Variation (CV)

Expresses variability relative to the mean as a percentage.

**Formula:**

```
CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100%
```

**Uses:**

- Compare variability of datasets with different means
- Commonly used in biology, chemistry, and engineering

## Univariate Analysis Graphs

### 1. Categorical Data - Frequency Distribution Table

**Components:**

- **Frequency**: Number of times each value occurs
- **Relative Frequency**: Proportion/percentage of each category
  ```
  Relative Frequency = Frequency / Total Observations
  ```
- **Cumulative Frequency**: Running total of frequencies

**Example: Vacation Preferences Survey (200 people)**

| Vacation Type | Frequency | Relative Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Beach         | 60        | 30%                | 60                   |
| City          | 40        | 20%                | 100                  |
| Adventure     | 35        | 17.5%              | 135                  |
| Nature        | 30        | 15%                | 165                  |
| Cruise        | 25        | 12.5%              | 190                  |
| Other         | 10        | 5%                 | 200                  |

- **Right-skewed**: Tail extends to the right
- **Left-skewed**: Tail extends to the left
- **Uniform**: All values occur with equal frequency
- **Bimodal**: Two peaks in the distribution

A **contingency table** (crosstab) summarizes the relationship between two categorical variables.

**Example: Gender vs Product Preference**

|           | Product A | Product B | Product C | Total   |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Male      | 25        | 30        | 15        | 70      |
| Female    | 35        | 20        | 25        | 80      |
| **Total** | **60**    | **50**    | **40**    | **150** |

### 2. Numerical - Numerical: Scatter Plot

Scatter plots show the relationship between two numerical variables.

**Correlation Types:**

- **Positive**: As one variable increases, the other increases
- **Negative**: As one variable increases, the other decreases
- **No correlation**: No apparent relationship

## Connection to Machine Learning

Statistics forms the foundation of machine learning because:

1. **Data Understanding**: Descriptive statistics help understand data patterns
2. **Feature Selection**: Statistical measures identify important variables
3. **Model Validation**: Statistical tests evaluate model performance
4. **Probability**: ML algorithms are based on statistical probability
5. **Inference**: Both fields draw conclusions from data samples

Understanding these statistical concepts is crucial for effective data analysis and machine learning applications.
