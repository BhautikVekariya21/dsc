## What is Normal Distribution?

Normal distribution, also known as **Gaussian distribution**, is a probability distribution that is commonly used in statistical analysis. It is a continuous probability distribution that is:

- **Symmetrical** around the mean
- **Bell-shaped** curve
- Has **asymptotic** tails (approaching but never touching the x-axis)
- Contains **lots of points near the mean** and **very few far away**

### Key Characteristics:

- **Tail**: The distribution has tails that extend infinitely in both directions
- **Asymptotic nature**: The tails approach but never touch the x-axis
- **Concentration**: Most data points cluster around the mean

---

## Why is Normal Distribution Important?

### Commonality in Nature

Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution, including:

- Heights of people
- Weights of objects
- IQ scores of a population
- Measurement errors
- Test scores

This makes the normal distribution a convenient way to model and analyze real-world data.

## PDF Equation and Parameters

The normal distribution is characterized by **two parameters**:

- **μ (mu)**: The mean - represents the center of the distribution
- **σ (sigma)**: The standard deviation - represents the spread of the distribution

### Notation:

```
X ~ N(μ, σ²)
```

### Probability Density Function (PDF):

```
f(x) = (1 / (σ√(2π))) * e^(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))
```

Where:

- e ≈ 2.71828 (Euler's number)
- π ≈ 3.14159
- x = variable value
- μ = mean
- σ = standard deviation

## Standard Normal Variate

### What is Standard Normal Variate?

A **Standard Normal Variate (Z)** is a standardized form of the normal distribution with:

- **Mean = 0**
- **Standard deviation = 1**

### Standardization Formula:

```
Z = (X - μ) / σ
```

Where:

- Z = standardized value
- X = original value
- μ = mean of original distribution
- σ = standard deviation of original distribution

### Benefits of Standardization:

1. **Comparison**: Allows comparison of different distributions
2. **Probability calculation**: Use standardized tables or software
3. **Universal reference**: Creates a common scale for all normal distributions

### Example Problem:

_Heights of adult males follow N(68, 3²). What's the probability that a randomly selected male is taller than 72 inches?_

**Solution:**

```
Z = (72 - 68) / 3 = 4/3 = 1.33
```

---

## Z-Tables

### What are Z-Tables?

A **z-table** tells you the area underneath a normal distribution curve, to the left of the z-score.

### Key Points:

- Shows cumulative probability P(Z ≤ z)
- Values range from 0 to 1
- Used to find probabilities for standardized normal distribution
- Available online at resources like ztable.net

### Usage:

1. Calculate Z-score using standardization formula
2. Look up Z-score in z-table
3. Read corresponding probability value

---

## Properties of Normal Distribution

### 1. Symmetricity

- The normal distribution is **symmetric about its mean**
- Probability of observing a value above the mean = Probability of observing a value below the mean
- The bell-shaped curve reflects this symmetry

### 2. Measures of Central Tendency

In a normal distribution:

- **Mean = Median = Mode**
- All three measures of central tendency are equal and located at the center

### 3. Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)

- **68%** of data falls within **1 standard deviation** of the mean (μ ± σ)
- **95%** of data falls within **2 standard deviations** of the mean (μ ± 2σ)
- **99.7%** of data falls within **3 standard deviations** of the mean (μ ± 3σ)

### 4. Area Under the Curve

- Total area under the normal curve = 1
- Represents the total probability
- Area between any two points represents probability of values falling in that range

---

## Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)

For any normal distribution X ~ N(μ, σ):

| Range  | Percentage of Population |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| μ ± 1σ | ~68%                     |
| μ ± 2σ | ~95%                     |
| μ ± 3σ | ~99.7%                   |

This rule helps in:

- **Quality control**: Identifying unusual values
- **Risk assessment**: Understanding data spread
- **Outlier detection**: Values beyond 3σ are rare

## Skewness

### What is Skewness?

**Skewness** is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution. It describes the degree to which a dataset deviates from the normal distribution.

### Types of Skewness:

#### Positive Skewness (Right-skewed):

- Tail is longer on the **right side**
- Mean > Median > Mode
- Most data concentrated on the left

#### Negative Skewness (Left-skewed):

- Tail is longer on the **left side**
- Mean < Median < Mode
- Most data concentrated on the right

#### Zero Skewness:

- **Perfectly symmetrical** distribution
- Mean = Median = Mode
- Normal distribution has zero skewness

### Key Insight:

**The greater the skew, the greater the distance between mean, median, and mode.**

### Impact on Normal Distribution:

- Normal distribution assumes **zero skewness**
- Skewed data indicates **non-normal distribution**
- May require transformation for analysis

---

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The **CDF** of a normal distribution gives the probability that a random variable X takes a value less than or equal to x.

### Mathematical Definition:

```
F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∫[from -∞ to x] f(t) dt
```

### Properties:

- **Monotonically increasing**: Never decreases
- **Range**: 0 to 1
- **Smooth S-shaped curve**
- **Inflection point** at the mean

### Applications:

- Finding probabilities for ranges
- Percentile calculations
- Hypothesis testing

---

## Applications in Data Science

### 1. Outlier Detection

- Values beyond **μ ± 3σ** are considered outliers
- **Z-score method**: |Z| > 3 indicates outlier
- Critical for data cleaning and preprocessing

### 2. Machine Learning Assumptions

Many ML algorithms assume normality:

- **Linear Regression**: Residuals should be normally distributed
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Assumes normal components
- **Principal Component Analysis**: Often works better with normal data

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

- **t-tests**: Compare means assuming normal distributions
- **ANOVA**: Analysis of variance
- **Confidence intervals**: Based on normal distribution properties

### 4. Central Limit Theorem

- **Sample means** approach normal distribution as sample size increases
- Enables inference about population parameters
- Foundation for many statistical methods

### 5. Quality Control

- **Control charts**: Monitor process variation
- **Six Sigma**: Quality improvement methodology
- **Process capability analysis**

### 6. Risk Management

- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Financial risk assessment
- **Monte Carlo simulations**: Risk modeling
- **Portfolio optimization**

## Python Implementation Tips

### Generating Normal Distribution:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

# Generate normal distribution
mu, sigma = 0, 1
x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100)
y = stats.norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma)

# Plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Standard Normal Distribution')
plt.show()
```

### Standardization:

```python
# Standardize data
def standardize(data):
    return (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)
```

### Skewness Calculation:

```python
from scipy.stats import skew

# Calculate skewness
skewness = skew(data)
```

Understanding normal distribution and its properties is essential for:

- Data analysis and interpretation
- Model selection and validation

The concepts of standardization, empirical rule, and skewness provide powerful tools for data scientists to understand, analyze, and make decisions based on data.
