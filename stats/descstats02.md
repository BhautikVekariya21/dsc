## Types of Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics deals with the **collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data**. It focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a set of data, without making inferences or predictions about the larger population.

### 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics deals with **making conclusions and predictions about a population based on a sample**. It involves:

- Use of probability theory to estimate likelihood of events
- Hypothesis testing to determine if claims about population are supported
- Regression analysis to examine relationships between variables

## Population vs Sample

### Population

**Population** refers to the entire group of individuals or objects that we are interested in studying. It is the complete set of observations that we want to make inferences about.

**Examples:**

- All cricket fans
- All students in a school
- All cars in a city

### Sample

A **sample** is a subset of the population. It is a smaller group of individuals or objects that we select from the population to study.

**Examples:**

- Cricket fans present in the stadium
- Students who visit college for lectures
- 100 randomly selected students

### Things to Consider When Creating Samples

1. **Sample Size** - Must be adequate for reliable results
2. **Random** - Selection should be unbiased
3. **Representative** - Should reflect population characteristics

### Parameter vs Statistics

- **Parameter**: A characteristic of a **population** (generally unknown)
- **Statistic**: A characteristic of a **sample** (used to estimate parameters)

## Measures of Central Tendency

A **measure of central tendency** is a statistical measure that represents a typical or central value for a dataset.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1635070041078-e363dbe005cb?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Calculator and mathematical calculations for statistical measures" width="800" height="400">

### 1. Mean (Arithmetic Average)

The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

**Formula:**

```
Mean (x̄) = (x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + ... + xₙ) / n
```

**Mathematical Notation:**

```
x̄ = Σx / n
```

Where:

- x̄ = sample mean
- Σx = sum of all values
- n = number of observations

### 2. Median

The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending order.

**For odd number of values:**

```
Median = Middle value
```

**For even number of values:**

```
Median = (n/2 term + (n/2 + 1) term) / 2
```

### 3. Mode

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.

- **Unimodal**: One mode
- **Bimodal**: Two modes
- **Multimodal**: More than two modes

### 4. Weighted Mean

Used when values have different importance or frequency.

**Formula:**

```
Weighted Mean = Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) / Σwᵢ
```

Where:

- xᵢ = individual values
- wᵢ = corresponding weights

### 5. Trimmed Mean

Calculated by removing a certain percentage of smallest and largest values, then taking the mean of remaining values.

**Steps:**

1. Arrange data in ascending order
2. Remove specified percentage from both ends
3. Calculate mean of remaining values

## Measures of Dispersion

**Measure of dispersion** describes the spread or variability of a dataset around the central tendency.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb0?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Statistical charts showing data variability and spread" width="800" height="400">

### 1. Range

The difference between maximum and minimum values.

**Formula:**

```
Range = Maximum value - Minimum value
```

### 2. Variance

The average of squared differences from the mean.

**Population Variance:**

```
σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / N
```

**Sample Variance:**

```
s² = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² / (n-1)
```

**Example Calculation:**

| X   | X - Mean | (X - Mean)² |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 3   | 0        | 0           |
| 2   | -1       | 1           |
| 1   | -2       | 4           |
| 5   | 2        | 4           |
| 4   | 1        | 1           |

Variance = 10/5 = 2

### 3. Standard Deviation

The square root of variance.

**Formula:**

```
Standard Deviation (σ or s) = √Variance
```

### 4. Coefficient of Variation (CV)

Expresses variability relative to the mean as a percentage.

**Formula:**

```
CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100%
```

**Uses:**

- Compare variability of datasets with different means
- Commonly used in biology, chemistry, and engineering

## Univariate Analysis Graphs

### 1. Categorical Data - Frequency Distribution Table

**Components:**

- **Frequency**: Number of times each value occurs
- **Relative Frequency**: Proportion/percentage of each category
  ```
  Relative Frequency = Frequency / Total Observations
  ```
- **Cumulative Frequency**: Running total of frequencies

**Example: Vacation Preferences Survey (200 people)**

| Vacation Type | Frequency | Relative Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Beach         | 60        | 30%                | 60                   |
| City          | 40        | 20%                | 100                  |

## Bivariate Analysis Graphs

### 1. Categorical - Categorical: Contingency Table

A **contingency table** (crosstab) summarizes the relationship between two categorical variables.

**Example: Gender vs Product Preference**

|           | Product A | Product B | Product C | Total   |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Male      | 25        | 30        | 15        | 70      |
| Female    | 35        | 20        | 25        | 80      |
| **Total** | **60**    | **50**    | **40**    | **150** |

### 2. Numerical - Numerical: Scatter Plot

Scatter plots show the relationship between two numerical variables.

**Correlation Types:**

- **Positive**: As one variable increases, the other increases
- **Negative**: As one variable increases, the other decreases
- **No correlation**: No apparent relationship

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1666875753105-c63a6f3bdc86?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Scatter plot showing correlation between two variables" width="800" height="400">

### 3. Categorical - Numerical

Common visualizations include:

- **Box plots** by category
- **Bar charts** showing means by category

## Quantiles and Percentiles

**Quantiles** are statistical measures used to divide a set of numerical data into equal-sized groups, with each group containing an equal number of observations. They help understand data distribution, summarize datasets, compare different datasets, and identify outliers.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587560699334-cc4ff634909a?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Data distribution showing quartiles and percentiles" width="800" height="400">

### Types of Quantiles

1. **Quartiles**: Divide data into 4 equal parts

   - Q1 (25th percentile) - First quartile
   - Q2 (50th percentile) - Median
   - Q3 (75th percentile) - Third quartile

2. **Deciles**: Divide data into 10 equal parts

   - D1 (10th percentile), D2 (20th percentile), ..., D9 (90th percentile)

3. **Percentiles**: Divide data into 100 equal parts

   - P1 (1st percentile), P2 (2nd percentile), ..., P99 (99th percentile)

4. **Quintiles**: Divide data into 5 equal parts

### Important Points About Quantiles

1. **Data should be sorted** from low to high
2. You are finding the **location** of an observation
3. They are **not actual values** in the data
4. All other quantiles can be **derived from percentiles**

### Percentile Calculation

**Formula for Percentile Location:**

```
PL = (N × p) / 100
```

Where:

- PL = desired percentile value location
- N = total number of observations
- p = percentile rank (as percentage)

**Example: Find 75th percentile**
Data: 78, 82, 84, 88, 91, 93, 94, 96, 98, 99

**Step 1:** Sort the data (already sorted)
**Step 2:** Calculate location: PL = (10 × 75) / 100 = 7.5
**Step 3:** Take average of 7th and 8th values: (94 + 96) / 2 = 95

### Percentile Rank of a Value

**Formula:**

```
Percentile Rank = [(X + 0.5Y) / N] × 100
```

Where:

- X = number of values below the given value
- Y = number of values equal to the given value
- N = total number of values

---

## Five-Number Summary

The **five-number summary** provides a complete overview of a dataset's distribution using five key values:

1. **Minimum Value**: Smallest value in dataset
2. **First Quartile (Q1)**: 25th percentile
3. **Median (Q2)**: 50th percentile
4. **Third Quartile (Q3)**: 75th percentile
5. **Maximum Value**: Largest value in dataset

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

The **IQR** measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

**Formula:**

```
IQR = Q3 - Q1
```

The IQR is useful because it's **resistant to outliers** and provides a robust measure of variability.

## Box Plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots)

A **box plot** is a graphical representation showing the distribution of data based on the five-number summary.

### Components of a Box Plot

1. **Box**: Represents IQR (Q1 to Q3)
2. **Median Line**: Line inside the box
3. **Whiskers**: Lines extending from box to min/max (or to 1.5×IQR)
4. **Outliers**: Points beyond the whiskers

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606107557195-0e29a4b5b4aa?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Box plot diagram showing statistical distribution" width="800" height="400">

### Benefits of Box Plots

- **Easy visualization** of data distribution
- **Shows skewness** of data
- **Identifies outliers** clearly
- **Compares multiple categories** side by side
- **Compact representation** of key statistics

### Creating Box Plots

**Steps:**

1. Calculate five-number summary
2. Draw box from Q1 to Q3
3. Mark median inside box
4. Draw whiskers to min/max (or 1.5×IQR rule)
5. Plot outliers as individual points

### Side-by-Side Box Plots

Useful for comparing distributions across different categories or groups.

## Scatter Plots and Relationships

**Scatter plots** visualize the relationship between two numerical variables by plotting data points on a coordinate system.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1666875753105-c63a6f3bdc86?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Scatter plot showing relationship between variables" width="800" height="400">

### Types of Relationships

1. **Positive Correlation**: As X increases, Y increases
2. **Negative Correlation**: As X increases, Y decreases
3. **No Correlation**: No apparent relationship
4. **Non-linear Relationship**: Curved or complex patterns

---

## Covariance

**Covariance** measures the degree to which two variables are linearly related and how they change together.

### What Problem Does Covariance Solve?

Covariance helps us understand:

- Whether two variables move together
- The direction of their relationship
- Joint variability between variables

### Interpretation

- **Positive Covariance**: Variables move in the same direction
- **Negative Covariance**: Variables move in opposite directions
- **Zero Covariance**: No linear relationship

### Calculation Formula

**Population Covariance:**

```
Cov(X,Y) = Σ[(Xi - μx)(Yi - μy)] / N
```

**Sample Covariance:**

```
Cov(X,Y) = Σ[(Xi - x̄)(Yi - ȳ)] / (n-1)
```

### Example Calculation

**Experience vs Salary:**

| Exp(X) | Salary(Y) | X-X̄ | Y-Ȳ | (X-X̄)(Y-Ȳ) |
| ------ | --------- | --- | --- | ---------- |
| 2      | 1         | -6  | -5  | 30         |
| 5      | 2         | -3  | -4  | 12         |
| 8      | 5         | 0   | -1  | 0          |
| 12     | 12        | 4   | 6   | 24         |
| 13     | 10        | 5   | 4   | 20         |

Covariance = 86/4 = 21.5 (positive relationship)

### Covariance of Variable with Itself

```
Cov(X,X) = Var(X)
```

The covariance of a variable with itself equals its variance.

### Disadvantages of Covariance

- **Scale-dependent**: Affected by units of measurement
- **Difficult to interpret magnitude**: No standard scale
- **Cannot determine strength**: Only shows direction

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587560699334-cc4ff634909a?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Covariance visualization showing variable relationships" width="800" height="400">

---

## Correlation

**Correlation** measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

### What Problem Does Correlation Solve?

Correlation addresses covariance limitations by:

- Providing a **standardized measure** (-1 to +1)
- Indicating both **direction and strength**
- Being **scale-independent**

### Correlation Coefficient

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient:**

```
r = Cov(X,Y) / (σx × σy)
```

**Alternative Formula:**

```
r = Σ[(Xi - x̄)(Yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(Xi - x̄)² × Σ(Yi - ȳ)²]
```

### Interpretation Scale

- **r = +1**: Perfect positive correlation
- **r = 0**: No linear correlation
- **r = -1**: Perfect negative correlation
- **|r| > 0.7**: Strong correlation
- **0.3 < |r| < 0.7**: Moderate correlation
- **|r| < 0.3**: Weak correlation

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=800&h=400&fit=crop&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb" alt="Correlation coefficient examples showing different strengths" width="800" height="400">

### Correlation vs Causation

**"Correlation does not imply causation"**

Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other.

**Example:**

- **Observation**: Positive correlation between firefighters at a fire and damage caused
- **Wrong Conclusion**: More firefighters cause more damage
- **Reality**: Fire severity (third variable) affects both firefighters needed and damage caused

**Establishing Causation Requires:**

- Controlled experiments
- Randomized controlled trials
- Well-designed observational studies
- Consideration of confounding variables
